            	<p>Ah, look at all the lonely people
                    Ah, look at all the lonely people
                    Eleanor Rigby
                     Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
                    Lives in a dream
                    Waits at the window
                    Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
                    Who is it for?
            
                    All the lonely people
                    Where do they all come from?
                    All the lonely people
                    Where do they all belong?
            
            
            
                    Father McKenzie
                     Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
                    No one comes near
                    Look at him working
                    Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
                    What does he care?
            
                    All the lonely people
                    Where do they all come from?
                    All the lonely people
                    Where do they all belong?
            
                    Ah, look at all the lonely people
            
                    Ah, look at all the lonely people
            
                    Eleanor Rigby
                    Died in the church and was buried along with her name
                    Nobody came
                    Father McKenzie
                    Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
                    No one was saved
            
                    All the lonely people (ah, look at all the lonely people)
                    Where do they all come from?
                    All the lonely people (ah, look at all the lonely people)
                    Where do they all belong?</p>
